The book is intended for English language students at Pedagogical Universities
taking the course of English lexicology and fully meets the requirements of the
programme in the subject. It may also be of interest to all readers, whose command of
English is sufficient to enable them to read texts of average difficulty and who would
like to gain some information about the vocabulary resources of Modern English (for
example, about synonyms and antonyms), about the stylistic peculiarities of English
vocabulary, about the complex nature of the word's meaning and the modern methods
of its investigation, about English idioms, about those changes that English
vocabulary underwent in its historical development and about some other aspects of
English lexicology. One can hardly acquire a perfect command of English without
having knowledge of all these things, for a perfect command of a language implies
the conscious approach to the language's resources and at least a partial
understanding of the "inner mechanism" which makes the huge language system
work.

In this book the reader will find the fundamentals of the word theory and of the
main problems associated with English vocabulary, its characteristics and
subdivisions.

The aim of the course is to teach students to be word-conscious, to be able to
guess the meaning of words they come across from the meanings of morphemes, to
be able to recognise the origin of this or that lexical unit.
